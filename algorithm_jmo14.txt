Assignment 1 

Step 1
In this step have a if statement to check if the number of arguments is equal to 2. If not, the usage function will print “ YYYYMMDD | YYYY/MM/DD | YYYY-MM-DD | YYYY.MM.DD” and then the module will be exited.

Step 2
If there are two arguments created the script will continue. An array will be created called ‘month_name’ storing all the months from Jan-Dec. A hash table will also be created called ‘days_in_month’. Storing the month number and the number of days in that month, example: January will be stored as {1:31}. The first argument of the module will also be stored in a variable ‘user_raw_data’.

Step 3

The allowed variable is declared in the allow_char variable. Then the sanitize function will run with argument (user_raw_data, allow_chars), storing the output into variable ‘dob’. The result will be printed in the format ‘Sanitized user data: ‘, dob.


Step 4

Size_check function will run with argument (dob,8) and be stored in the variable called ‘result’. An if statement will then print “Error 09: wrong data entered” if the dob character length is not equal to 8, then exit the module.


Step 5

If the variable result I true then the script will continue, and the year, month, and day variable will be made with integer values of dob [0:4], dob [4:6], and dob [6: ] assigned to the previous listed variables in the am order.

Step 6

The function range_check will be used to check for four key details. 
If the year is within the range of 1900 to 1999, 
if not the then the module will print an error message “Error 10: year out of range, must be 1900 or later” and then will exit the module. 
If the month I between 1-12, if not the module will print “Error 02: Wrong month entered” and then will exit. 
If the leap year function comes back true then an extra day will be added into February. 
If the day is not specified within that range that I in the days of the month then module will print “Error 03: wrong day entered” and then exit. all values show on return in this step will be put in the variable call ‘result’.

Step 7

The new standard format of “mmm d, yyyy” is created for the dob, saved in variable ‘new_dob’

Step 8

The module will print (“Your date of birth is: “ , new_dob).
